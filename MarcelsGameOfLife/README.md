# Marcel's Game of Life

Of course, this will be just an implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
I have to say, I never implemented in my whole life this cellular automat fully. Some tries were done in Java, but never finished.
So, let's use the current situation (#covid19) and just do a SW-based project. Afar from Euler and ESP32.
