# AwayHandler

Idea is to set the away/online status with one click (into the try) for Skype, Jabber and RocketChat at once.
So a tray-icon with menu is needed. Then some actions to set the state (maybe via hotkey-combos first).

Plan is to use PyAutoIt (because AutoIt itself is maybe too oldschool): <https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoIt/>

## programs to be handled
* skype
* jabber
* teams
* rocketchat
* zoom

## states to be handled
All of the aforementioned programs support this intersection of states:
* online
* away
* busy

## hotkeys to assign
Maybe ALT + SHIFT + char would be something, which does not block other programs?
