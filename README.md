# pythonCollection

Container for scripts and solutions for:
* daily tasks (file manipulation/log evaluation/ whitespace fixing)
* dayily programming challenge-taskes
* and Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) challenges

The idea is: while doing the continuous exercises to gain Python-knowledge. 'You only learn programming by programming.'

Feel free to get some inspirations :)
