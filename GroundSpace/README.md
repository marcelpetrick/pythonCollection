Tiny program to fill your harddrive with characters of your choice.  
Initially some terminal-script, but I got the idea to play a bit around with PyQt for a pretty ui.  
And yes, it is usable. Learnt a lot.  
Qt for C++ is nice, but PyQt is really easy and fast to develop. :thumbsup:

## Prerequisites aka Pip

$ pip install PyQt5

## How to use?
* run the script
* initial state of the ui:

* set parameters for pattern, repetitions and click "Run, Forrest!"
* watch the progressbar moving to 100% :'D
