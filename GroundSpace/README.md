# GroundSpace

Tiny program to fill your harddrive with characters of your choice.  
Initially some terminal-script, but I got the idea to play a bit around with PyQt for a pretty ui.  
And yes, it is usable. Learnt a lot.  
Qt for C++ is nice, but PyQt is really easy and fast to develop. :thumbsup:

## Prerequisites aka Pip

$ pip install PyQt5

## How to use?
* run the script
* this is how the ui looks:  
![screenshot of the current UI state](ui_currentState.png)
* set parameters for pattern, repetitions and click "Run, Forrest!"
* watch the progressbar moving to 100% :'D

## planned ideas
* add some option to let it run infinitely (until the space is used up)
* display the current writing-speed
