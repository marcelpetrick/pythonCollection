# Special Pythagorean triplet
#
# Problem 9
# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
#
# a2 + b2 = c2
# For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
#
# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc.

# idea:
# how to generate them efficently?
# "Euclid's formula[3] is a fundamental formula for generating Pythagorean triples given an arbitrary pair of integers m and n with m > n > 0. The formula states that the integers
#
#     a = m 2 âˆ’ n 2 ,   b = 2 m n ,   c = m 2 + n 2 {\displaystyle a=m^{2}-n^{2},\ \,b=2mn,\ \,c=m^{2}+n^{2}} a=m^{2}-n^{2},\ \,b=2mn,\ \,c=m^{2}+n^{2}
#
# form a Pythagorean triple. "
