# Coded triangle numbers
#
# Problem 42
# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
#
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
#
# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values
# we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle
# number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
#
# Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common
# English words, how many are triangle words?

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# idea:
# 0. read the file, split the line, compute for each word the value and while going through the list, find the maximum.
# 1. Then generate triangle numbers until you are bigger than that maximum. store the triangle numbers in a dictionary.
# 2. check for each word-value if triangle number: if yes, then +1
# 3. return the result -- profit
