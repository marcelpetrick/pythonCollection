# lastfmLovedSongsToLocalYoutubePlayer

Title already states it: plan is to create a standalone player, which allows to get all last.fm-loved songs of a user (make this configurable via ui),
then list songs in a table. Allow some sorting via artist or title, maybe even a search.
Then allow to play each song. Add a stop button as well.
Also: the song-to-youtube-url shall be preprocessed (concurrently in background) to save time.

Maybe use the last.fm-API instead of "MyFirstLastFmCrawler".
