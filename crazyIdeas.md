# Open ideas:

* is now project "CppIncludeFixer": include-fixer for C++
* is now project "BLA": script/program (maybe pyqt interface), which allows to drop a zip of a LogFile and then given you a collection of all warnings (sorted ascending) --> see @BLA
* web-scraping: how to login to pages, which need credentials? (Like TeamCity) for automated download of some build-logs? (for later processing)

# Done
* Script which modifies the current cpp input file in a way that everything is aligned right. Right limiter shall be based on the maximum line length. Should be usable as cmd for xargs in bash.
