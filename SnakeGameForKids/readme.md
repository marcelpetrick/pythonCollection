# snake game for kids

* no walls on all sides of the game board - collisions are no fun for kids
* snake moves relatively slow (maybe user-adjustable)
* movement should be changeable from "direct" arrow-direction to "relative" (where just left/right) make the snake turn
* randomly popping up items like apples and chicken leg
* should it grow when it eats a fruit - yes, definitely
