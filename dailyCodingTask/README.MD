# What is this?<br>
This is the collection of all finished implementations of coding challenges (from different companies). Each day I receive a newsletter and if there is the opportunity (in time ..), I solve it.
Most of the time some clever algorithm reduces lots of the work.
I try to avoid common libraries to get my hands "dirty" with Python. I want to understand it and learn.
Of course: while doing this, I re-invent the wheel ;)
