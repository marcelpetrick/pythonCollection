# Got an e-mail which announced some funding-camppaign.
# But what is the number? Got me curious? Decided to find the first number which fits that description. But not manually ..
# " All I can say is that the Kickstarter price is a prime, a safe prime, a supersingular prime, a Lucas prime, and an Eisenstein prime.
# It is also a highly cototient number, a Keith number, a strictly non-palindromic number, and a Carol number. "

# Even without program I can see the number 47 as number, which stands out.
# Especially if you check it with the caro numbers. 7 is not Eisenstein prime, but next Caro Number 47 is
